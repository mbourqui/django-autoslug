Django-autoslugged is a reusable Django library that provides an
improved slug field which can automatically:

a)  populate itself from another field,
b)  preserve uniqueness of the value and
c)  use custom slugify() functions for better i18n.

The field is highly configurable.

Requirements
============

* [Python][] >= 2.7 or PyPy
* [Django][] >= 1.8

It may be possible to successfully use django-autoslugged in other
environments but they are not tested.

> **note**
>
> PyPy3 is not officially supported only because there were some
> problems with permissions and \_\_pycache\_\_ on CI unrelated to
> django-autoslugged itself.

Examples
========

A simple example:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from django.db.models import CharField, Model
from autoslugged import AutoSlugField

class Article(Model):
    title = CharField(max_length=200)
    slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from='title')
```

More complex example:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from django.db.models import CharField, DateField, ForeignKey, Model
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from autoslugged import AutoSlugField

class Article(Model):
    title = CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = DateField(auto_now_add=True)
    author = ForeignKey(User)
    slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from=lambda instance: instance.title,
                         unique_with=['author__name', 'pub_date__month'],
                         slugify=lambda value: value.replace(' ','-'))
```

Since the original project
([django-autoslug](<https://github.com/neithere/django-autoslug>)) was
not maintained anymore but I was using it in several projects, I forked
it and renamed it in order to publish a new release on PyPI.
